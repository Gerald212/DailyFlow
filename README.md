# DailyFlow
## About
DailyFlow is an application for tracking the time spent performing certain activities. The structure of the application is based on an interactive list in which all the types of tasks the user wants to control are included, divided into categories. It allows the user to add tasks with a specific due date and habits that can be updated with the time spent on them. This makes it easier to maintain efficiency and track the progress made in a particular area.

The app was created as a practical part of a bachelor thesis on the use of React Native in mobile app development.
## Installation and Setup
DailyFlow was created using the Expo Go developer toolkit.

- Set up the development environment, using Expo Go toolkit: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.
- Clone repository
- Install dependencies: npm install.
- Run server: npm start. Then use app Expo Go on your mobile and scan QR code on the terminal.

Alternatively, you can use the ready-made .apk file found in root.
